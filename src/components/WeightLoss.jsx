        <h2>High-Protein Foods</h2>
        <p>Protein is essential for preserving muscle mass while losing fat and helps you feel full longer, reducing overall calorie intake. Include sources like lean meats (chicken breast, turkey), fish, eggs, tofu, legumes, and low-fat dairy.</p>

        <h2>Whole Grains</h2>
        <p>Opt for complex carbohydrates that provide sustained energy and keep you feeling full. Whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole wheat products are excellent choices.</p>

        <h2>Healthy Fats</h2>
        <p>Don't eliminate fats entirely; they're crucial for hormone production and overall health. Focus on unsaturated fats found in foods like avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish (salmon, mackerel).</p>

        <h2>Lots of Vegetables</h2>
        <p>Vegetables are low in calories and high in fiber, making them ideal for weight loss. They also provide essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Aim to fill half your plate with vegetables at each meal, focusing on a variety of colors and types.</p>

        <h2>Limited Sugars and Processed Foods</h2>
        <p>Minimize intake of sugary beverages, processed snacks, and foods high in added sugars and unhealthy fats. These can contribute excess calories and hinder fat loss efforts.</p>

        <h2>Portion Control</h2>
        <p>Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating, even of healthy foods. Use smaller plates, measure servings, and practice mindful eating to tune in to your body's hunger and fullness cues.</p>

        <h2>Hydration</h2>
        <p>Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes, thirst can be mistaken for hunger, leading to unnecessary calorie consumption.</p>

        <h2>Regular Meals and Snacks</h2>
        <p>Aim for consistent meal timing to keep energy levels stable and prevent overeating. Include healthy snacks between meals to curb hunger and prevent binge eating.</p>

        <h2>Limit Alcohol</h2>
        <p>Alcoholic beverages are high in calories and can sabotage fat loss efforts. Limit intake and opt for lower-calorie options like light beer or spirits mixed with calorie-free mixers.</p>

        <h2>Physical Activity</h2>
        <p>While not part of the diet per se, regular exercise is crucial for fat loss and overall health. Incorporate a combination of cardio and strength training exercises to burn calories, build muscle, and boost metabolism.</p>
